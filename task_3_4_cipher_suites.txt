TLS_RSA_RC4_128_MD5
    RSA is used to exchange keys for the communication
    RSA is also used for authentication
    RC4 is used to encrypt the communication
    MD5 is used to secure the integrity of data

TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
    ECDHE is used to exchange keys for the communication
    RSA is used for authentication
    AES with GCM is used to encrypt the communication
    SHA256 is used to secure the integrity of data

Md5 vs Sha256
    Md5 has 128 bit hash value,
    Sha256 has 256 bit hash value,
    so the possibility to have the same hash for two different messages is much much smaller for Sha256,
    furthermore Md5 might be broken

RC4 vs AES
    RC4 is a block cipher. It is fast, simpler, not so secure. RC4 might be broken.
    AES is a stream cipher. It is not so fast, but much more secure.
